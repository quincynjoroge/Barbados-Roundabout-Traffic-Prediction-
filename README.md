# Barbados Traffic Prediction Challenge 🚦

**Challenge Page:** [Zindi – Barbados Traffic Analysis Challenge](https://zindi.africa/competitions/barbados-traffic-analysis-challenge)

This project aims to **predict traffic congestion in a specific roundabout in Barbados** using machine learning, with the goal of identifying the **root causes of congestion**. The insights generated from this analysis can help the Ministry of Transport and Works design interventions to improve traffic flow across the island.  

## Project Overview

On the small island of Barbados, cars, buses, and taxis are the primary modes of transport, and traffic congestion is a significant problem affecting daily life. This project uses **video data streams labeled with congestion ratings** to predict traffic congestion **five minutes into the future**. The ultimate objective is to **understand contributing factors** to traffic delays.  

## My Contribution

- Participated in **data preprocessing** and feature extraction from the provided video streams.  
- Built **machine learning models** to predict traffic congestion using structured and derived features.  
- Focused on **interpreting model outputs** to identify key factors contributing to congestion.  

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python** for data processing and model building  
- **Open-source ML packages** (scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, etc.)  
- Video processing libraries (e.g., OpenCV, Yolov8) for feature extraction
